XID mapping should be logged for debugging purposes, but must have reasonable log rotation mechanism

Core of code should probably just pass OF messages, and VlanVirtualizer can decide what to do with each message
  * Decrease code duplication for different kinds of OF messages
  * Limit usage of external libraries to less classes
  
Comment EVERYTHING

Actually fix FIXMEs

Add heartbeat code (generate echo requests)

Ensure that synchronization code actually works (it probably doesn't but that isn't current focus)

Slice actions on packet-out and flowmod from controller

per device device-to-slicer XID map (not critical at this time)

Slice object should be able to look up which VLANs are on which devices in the slice

Slicelet = VLAN on device + ports
VLAN on device can only belong to one slice

Integrate all classes with SlicerConfig
